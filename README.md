# Dungeon Generation Code
- Using GameDev2D (from algonquin college)
- Place randomly sized boxes inside of a circle
- Seperate the sqaures using AABB Collision
- Pick out the main rooms by % above average room size
- Construct a Delaunay Triangulation Graph
- Generate a minimum spanning tree based off of the graph
  - I used Kruskal's algorthim
  - Add some Removed lines back for more interesting dungeon
- Hallways
  - Make slanted lines straight for hallways
  - Bring back smaller rooms that overlap theses lines
  - Fill empty void with hallway
